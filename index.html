        <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
        <p>ACT 1</p>
        <p>PROLOGUE</p>
        Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
        <p>SCENE I. Verona. A public place. </p>
        <i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
        <p>SAMPSON</p>
        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
        <p>GREGORY</p>
        No, for then we should be colliers.
